# Fix Apache Error State and Make it accessible from outside

When you install Apache on a server, it may not start automatically or may be in an error state due to configuration issues. Additionally, by default, Apache may only be accessible from the localhost (127.0.0.1). This means that you won't be able to access it from other machines on the network.

## Use Cases:

- Serving static content
- Acting as a reverse proxy for other web servers
- Load balancing for web applications
