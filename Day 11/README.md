# Deploying a Java Application on Tomcat

Tomcat is a widely used open-source web server and servlet container that is designed to run Java applications. It provides a robust platform for deploying and managing Java-based web applications.

## Tomcat vs Apache HTTP Server
- **Tomcat**: Specifically designed to serve Java applications, supporting Java Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and other Java technologies. It is a servlet container that provides an environment for running Java code.
- **Apache HTTP Server**: A general-purpose web server that can serve static content and proxy requests to other servers. It does not natively support Java applications but can be configured to work with Tomcat through connectors like mod_jk or mod_proxy.

### From StackOverflow
Apache Tomcat is used to deploy your Java Servlets and JSPs. So in your Java project you can build your WAR (short for Web ARchive) file, and just drop it in the deploy directory in Tomcat.

So basically Apache is an HTTP Server, serving HTTP. Tomcat is a Servlet and JSP Server serving Java technologies.

Tomcat includes Catalina, which is a servlet container. A servlet, at the end, is a Java class. JSP files (which are similar to PHP, and older ASP files) are generated into Java code (HttpServlet), which is then compiled to .class files by the server and executed by the Java virtual machine.

Although Tomcat can be used as a general purpose http server, you can also set up Apache and Tomcat to work together with Apache serving static content and forwarding the requests for dynamic content to Tomcat.

So that means Tomcat is used to display dynamic content, and Apache is used to display static content. But Tomcat can also be used to display static content.

## Use Cases:
- Hosting Java-based web applications
- Running microservices built with Java
- Serving static content alongside dynamic Java applications

## Steps
1. **Install Tomcat**: Download and install Apache Tomcat from the official website (https://tomcat.apache.org/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2. **Configure Tomcat**: Modify the `server.xml` and `web.xml` files in the `conf` directory to set up your server and application configurations.
3. **Deploy Your Application**: Package your Java application as a WAR (Web Application Archive) file and place it in the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat installation. Tomcat will automatically deploy the application when it starts.
4. **Start Tomcat**: Use the startup script located in the `bin` directory to start the Tomcat server. For example, on Unix-based systems, you can run `./startup.sh`.
5. **Access Your Application**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/your-app-name` to access your deployed Java application. 
6. **Monitor Logs**: Check the Tomcat logs located in the `logs` directory for any errors or issues during deployment.

## Automation Ideas
### 1. Create a Deployment Script
You can create a shell script to automate the deployment of your Java application to Tomcat. This script can handle tasks such as copying the WAR file to the Tomcat webapps directory, restarting the Tomcat server, and checking the deployment status.
